				<h3>Business Registration</h3>
				<h4><strong>From J$7,500</strong></h4>
				<p>If you’re looking to start a business or formalise an existing business, business registration allows you to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Operate legally under a name other than your personal name.</li>
					<li>Advertise legally. </li>
					<li>Access business banking and funding.</li>
					<li>Be exempted from the 3% withholding tax requirement. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>Registering a business has different benefits from registering a company. You can convert a business into a company, but you can’t convert a company into a business. Seek legal advice to help you decide which is right for you.</p><br>

				<h3>Company Registration</h3>
				<h4><strong>From J$48,000</strong></h4>
				<p>In order to start a company, you must register it. Registering a company gives you the most of the same benefits as registering a business, but it also allows you to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Raise funds by selling company shares to investors.</li>
					<li>Protect your personal assets from being seized to pay company debts.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>That being said, there are some benefits of registering a business that don’t apply to companies. You can convert a business into a company, but you can’t convert a company into a business. Seek legal advice to help you decide which is right for you.</p><br>

				<h3>Tax Compliance Certificate (TCC)</h3>
				<h4><strong>From J$4,500 <br> (plus J$3,500 for each SO2 filed)</strong></h4>
				<p>A TCC shows that your business/ company is up to date with all of its tax payments. A TCC allows you to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Apply for certain industry licences/registrations.</li>
					<li>Apply for citizenship or work permits.</li>
					<li>Apply for government contracts.</li>
					<li>Apply to clear certain goods through Customs.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>TCCs are valid for 3 months, or up to 6 months if your business/company is a PAYE Contributor.</p><br>

				<h3>National Contracts Commission Registration (NCC)</h3>
				<h4><strong>From J$6,000</strong></h4>
				<p>Registering with the National Contracts Commission allows your business/ company to apply for government contracts worth $500,000 or more. </p>
				<p>To apply for an NCC, you’ll need:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>A TCC.</li>
					<li>A Letter of Good Standing from the Companies Office. </li>
					<li>A profile of your company.</li>
					<li>Qualifications of your project team.</li>
					<li>3 letters of recommendation.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>NCCs are valid for 18 months.</p><br>

				<h3>Trademarking</h3>
				<h4><strong>From J$26,000</strong></h4>
				<p>A trademark protects a distinctive visual representation of your brand. Trademarking allows you to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Protect your brand’s reputation by preventing others from using your trademark. </li>
					<li>Treat your trademark like an asset.</li>
					<li>Licence the use of your trademark to others.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>It can take as long as 10 months to get a trademark, so it’s better to start the process sooner rather than later.</p>
